            title="The first season of the Attack on Titan anime television series was produced by IG Port's Wit Studio and directed by Tetsurō Araki, with Yasuko Kobayashi handling series composition and Kyōji Asano providing character designs. It covers the first story arcs (chapters 1–34) from the original manga by Hajime Isayama.">Attack on Titan Season 1</a></p>
    <br>
    <p class="s">In the first season, the protagonist, Eren Jeager, witnesses his mother dying after being eaten by the
        series' main antagonists, the Titans. This becomes Eren's motivation to develop his combat skills in order to
        fight the Titans. Later on, Eren is eaten by a Titan himself but discovers that he can transform into a Titan,
        control it, and fight like he would as a human. Eren learns how to use his newfound powers to combat the Titans
        and continues his training as more titans continue to flood into his homeland.</p><br>
